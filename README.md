### 4. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database named `crypto_tracker`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE crypto_tracker;
```

2. Create the necessary tables by running the following SQL commands:

```sql
USE crypto_tracker;

-- Users table
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    pwd VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phnnum VARCHAR(15),
    balance DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Buy transactions table
CREATE TABLE buycrypto (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    cryptoname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    quantity DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    buyingprice DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    amountpaid DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    buy_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES user(username)
);

-- Sell transactions table
CREATE TABLE sellcrypto (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    cryptoname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    quantity DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    sellingprice DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    buyingprice DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    total_sell_amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    gain_loss DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    sell_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES user(username)
);

-- Withdrawals table
CREATE TABLE withdrawals (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    upi_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    withdrawal_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES user(username)
);
```

### 5. Configure Database Connection

Update the database connection in `db.py` with your MySQL credentials:
